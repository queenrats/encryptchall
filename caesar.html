        <h1>Caesar Ciphers</h1>
        <p>In ancient Rome, Julius Caesar would use a cipher to protect his military communications.</p>
        <p>He did this by “offsetting” each character by 3 places in the alphabet e.g. A becomes D, C becomes F, and letters like X, Y, and Z would “wrap-around” and become A, B, and C respectively.</p>
